A description of the project: what it does, the aim of the project, and what you learned

Milestone 1
In milestone 1, created the RDSDatabaseConnector class and multiple methods to allow me to extract the financial data from the AWS RDS database.
The load credentials function was created to allow for the credentials.yaml files (containing RDS connection credentials) to be opened and read.
THe connect to data base function allows you to connect to the RSD database and read the desired 'loan_payments' table.
The create_dataframe function allowed me to change the format of the loan_payments table to a dataframe.
The save data as csv function allowed me to save the newly created data frame to be saved locally.
